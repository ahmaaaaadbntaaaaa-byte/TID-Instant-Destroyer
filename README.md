## Overview
TID (The Instant Destroyer) is a hardware-enforced protocol designed to instantly zeroize cryptographic keys within CPU cache memory and provide verifiable Proof of Deletion (PoD).  
This concept introduces a new security paradigm for microarchitectural protection against transient data leakage and side-channel attacks.

## Features
- Instant key zeroization at hardware level.  
- Proof-of-Deletion mechanism integrated at chip stage.  
- Patent-eligible security innovation for trusted hardware architectures.
